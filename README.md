## What is El Grapho?

El Grapho is a high performance graph data visualization engine that leverages WebGL and streaming technologies.  El Grapho can support millions of interactive nodes and edges in any modern browser.

## Why would I use El Grapho?

If you need to build a graph of any kind, such as a tree, force directed graph, network, etc., and you want to have the most scalable, fastest, and most peformant graph data visualization as possible on the web, then El Grapho is a great option.  It was built from the ground up to scale as much as possible given modern constraints of browser execution speeds (CPUs) and OpenGL shader performance on graphics cards (GPUs)
