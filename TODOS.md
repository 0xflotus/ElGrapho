# TODOS

## P0
* box zoom
* need to figure out auto node sizing in order for node spacing to always be perfect, rather than requiring the user to guess the node size

## P1
* can I use ints in glsl where appropriate? Right now using all floats
* spike use css translate and transition to animate the zoom
* force directed graphs
