# TODOS

## P0
* consider using same API for cluster and tree.  I think it will be hard for consumers to map index to node for current tree api.
* box zoom doesn't work when scrolled.  oops.

## P1
* clusters should have same x and y magnitude so that there's no oval looking clusters
* back and forward buttons to go through state stack (pan and zoom)
* setup test app that pulls in elgrapho and bundles it
* tests and github CI
* node events should include x,y mouse position, or at least mouse event object
* can I use ints in glsl where appropriate? Right now using all floats
* spike use css translate and transition to animate the zoom
* performant force directed graph
* tooltips are slow in big network graph.
