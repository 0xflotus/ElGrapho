# TODOS

## P0
* force directed graph model

## P1
* setup test app that pulls in elgrapho and bundles it
* tests and github CI
* node events should include x,y mouse position, or at least mouse event object
* tooltips are slow in big network graph.
* labels
* investigate circle node performance
  * if this works out, could try dynamic node sizing
* node white outlines

## P2
* can I use ints in glsl where appropriate? Right now using all floats
* back and forward buttons to go through state stack (pan and zoom)
* chord diagram
* antialiased nodes - seems to require APIs in webgl2.  Currently using webgl1.
