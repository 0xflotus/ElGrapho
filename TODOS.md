# TODOS

## P0
* maybe get rid of magic zoom - should auto switch between magic zoom and not, depending on zoom level
* compute node spacing so that clusters don't overlap
* box zoom doesn't work when scrolled.  oops.

## P1
* setup test app that pulls in elgrapho and bundles it
* tests and github CI
* node events should include x,y mouse position, or at least mouse event object
* can I use ints in glsl where appropriate? Right now using all floats
* spike use css translate and transition to animate the zoom
