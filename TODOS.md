# TODOS

* click on nodes and change color
* pass in new state array, and let shader alter color based on state
  * 0 - normal
  * 1 - hover
  * 2 - selected
  * etc.
* SPIKE investigate using single integer as hit color and letting shader convert to components
* SPIKE investigate using colorIndex for point color and letting shader convert to components
* SPIKE try using normalized x,y positions and let shader convert
* can I use ints in glsl where appropriate? Right now using all floats
