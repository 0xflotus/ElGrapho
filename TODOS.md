# TODOS

## P0
* fix concrete dependency issue
* setup test app that pulls in elgrapho and bundles it
* performant force directed graph
* box zoom doesn't work when scrolled.  oops.
* tests and github CI
* add flag for scaling points and lines when you zoom (currently went back to not scaling them) - needed for dense graph visualizations
* node events should include x,y mouse position, or at least mouse event object

## P1
* can I use ints in glsl where appropriate? Right now using all floats
* spike use css translate and transition to animate the zoom
